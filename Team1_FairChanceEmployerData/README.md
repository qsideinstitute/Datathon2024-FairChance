# Team 1 - Fair Chance Employer Data

Team 1 is focused on creating a new fair chance employer dataset. This work is mostly non-technical and involves finding the locations of Obama White House Fair Chance Pledge signatories ([link to pledge](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/issues/criminal-justice/fair-chance-pledge)). The team will create a new employment index measure for each state by:

- Searching the web to gather data on Fair Chance Pledge signatories.
- Using Google Sheets to count the number of pledge signatories by state.

No prior experience is required for this team, making it a great opportunity for those interested in data collection and research without a technical background.

## Instructions

1. **Access Data**: The Fair Chance Pledge signatories dataset is available on Google Drive. To access it, please navigate to [bit.ly/fair-chance-pledge-data](https://bit.ly/fair-chance-pledge-data).
2. **Data Entry**: Fill in the Google Sheet with information about the Fair Chance Pledge Signatories, including:
   - Location (state or national) of each employer.
   - Number of employees (if available).
3. **Index Creation**: Use the compiled data to create an employment index for each state, which reflects the number of Fair Chance employers.
