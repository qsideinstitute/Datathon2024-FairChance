# Team 3 - Open-ended Research

Team 3 will address open-ended questions, providing an opportunity for creative exploration. This is unstructured technical work where participants will have access to our data and can experiment to come up with innovative solutions to advance the research. Potential areas of focus include:

- Creating data visualizations.
- Investigating auxiliary data sources (e.g., LinkedIn, HonestJobs).
- Automating existing R code to scrape Indeed on a weekly basis. If you are interested in this task, contact one of the group leaders to get access to our code.
- Using the data in other creative and ethical ways.

Participants should have proficiency in R and/or Python, and a desire to craft their own datathon goals. This team is ideal for those who enjoy working independently or in a small team, and are eager to explore new possibilities.
