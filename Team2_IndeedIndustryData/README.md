# Team 2 - Indeed Industry Data

Team 2 will collect fair chance job posting rates by industry. This is guided technical work that involves scraping data on job postings by industry (e.g., manufacturing and hospitality). The team will create an index measure for each state by:

- Scraping the web to gather job posting data by industry.
- Using the RSelenium package in R for web scraping.
- Gathering new data on job posting rates by industry.

Participants are kindly asked to download R and RStudio by Saturday morning. Support is provided in R, but participants who wish to use Python are welcome to do so on their own.
